PROJECT : BMI TRACKER APP

OBJECTIVES : To develop a Body Mass Index (BMI) tracker that calculates BMI based on user input for height and weight, and classifies the result as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity. The application will also provide visualizations for easy understanding of the user's BMI category and the distribution of BMI classifications.

# KEY ACTIVITIES

1. Project Planning and Requirement Gathering:
   - Define the application's purpose, target audience, and key features.
   - Conduct research on similar BMI calculation applications to gather ideas and best practices.

2. Data Collection and Preparation:
   - Collect and prepare sample data for BMI calculations.
   - Ensure data is clean and appropriately formatted for analysis.

3. Application Development:
   - User Interface (UI) Design:
     - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface using Google Colab.
     - Create input fields for users to enter their height and weight.
   - Backend Development:
     - Develop functions to calculate BMI and classify it into categories.
     - Implement the logic to process user inputs and generate BMI results.
     - Integrate the backend with the frontend to display results and visualizations.

4. Data Analysis and Visualization:
   - Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of BMI categories.
   - Create visualizations, such as pie charts and correlation plots, to help users understand their BMI classification.
   - Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating graphs and charts.

5. Prototyping:
   - Create interactive elements within Google Colab to allow users to input their data and receive immediate feedback.
   - Simulate user flows to test navigation and functionality.

6. Testing and Refinement:
   - Perform thorough testing of the application to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
   - Collect user feedback to refine and improve the application's performance and user experience.

7. Deployment:
   - Ensure the application is accessible to users through Google Colab.
   - Provide instructions for users on how to input their data and interpret the results.

8. User Support and Maintenance:
   - Provide user support to assist with any issues or queries.
   - Regularly update the application to incorporate new features and improvements.
